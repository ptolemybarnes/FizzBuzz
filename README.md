TDD FizzBuzz
============

An introduction to katas and more TDD principles
------------

The classic FizzBuzz kata, printing out numbers (usually 1 - 100), replacing numbers divisible by 3 with "Fizz", divisible by 5 with "Buzz", and divisible by 15 with "FizzBuzz".

Instructions
----------

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/spike01/FizzBuzz.git
```

`rspec` for the test suite. If you want to see the numbers actually printed out, either uncomment line 24 in `lib/fizzbuzz.rb`, or load into a REPL (`$ require './lib/fizzbuzz.rb'`) and run `puts 1..100 .map { |number| fizzbuzz number }`
